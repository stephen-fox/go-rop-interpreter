# weird go

Weird machine (?) experiments in Go.

## Projects

Projects are separated into their own directories.

- `load-lib` - Experiments with loading a shared object / dynamically linked
  library at runtime and finding creative ways to interact with said code
- `rop-interpreter` - Provide payloads as ROP chains at runtime in an effort
  to obfuscate code and evade antivirus / EDR
